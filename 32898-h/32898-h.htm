<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book presents a grindstone whereon
the reader may whet his wits. It is of sufficient
hardness to resist the coarsest metal of
broad-bladed humor, and of sufficient fineness
of grain to edge the best steel of fancy.</p>

<p>Like all grindstones, though its form is
new, its ingredients are of remote origin.
It has whetted many English and American
blades for the battle of ideas, and is, therefore,
in places, somewhat worn. There is,
however, much absolutely fresh surface.</p>

<p>Any blade of fine temper properly ground
upon it is warranted to cleave to the dividing
asunder of such subtle distinctions as that
between humorsome stupidity and precise
wit, and that between the wit of laughter
only and the wit of insight.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>A conundrum is a riddle in the form of
a question, the answer to which involves a
pun. Originally the term was applied to any
quaint expression. It is thus, in its modern
form, a union of the elaborated riddle and
the impromptu pun.</p>

<p>With the earliest development of intelligence
came the discovery of likeness and
difference in things, and the search for analogy
was carried out along both sensible and
absurd lines, the latter drifting into a double
analogy of thought and form, of which the
conundrum is the logical product.</p>

<p>The literatures of all peoples contain the
riddle, which might be witty or serious as
impulse prompted. All bright and clever
minds have seen the possibilities of the pun,
and so common is it as an impromptu form
of wit among keen people, so general the
temptation to fall into it, that it is looked
upon with disfavor, as a pitfall for thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
which often prevents it from finishing its
course.</p>

<p>The conundrum has, however, an ancient
and honorable lineage, and, while not often
given its precise form in conversation or
anecdote, is readily adapted to the permanent
embodiment of those flashes of wit
which enlighten and cheer.</p>

<p>The ability to guess and to propound riddles
was held in high respect in early times.
Men of great physical prowess were expected
to guess riddles to prove their mental
prowess, and many were the contests of this
sort which were held. The stakes in these
contests were very high,&mdash;often life or
honor. In Norse mythology the prize of
such a contest was once the daughter of the
god Thor; in another the life of the giant
Vafthrudnir was forfeit when he failed to
win in competition with the god Odin.</p>

<p>So in the old English ballad of the Elfin-knight,
a maiden saves herself from an evil
spirit by successfully guessing his riddles.
Among many primitive peoples the game of
riddle-reading was played with opposing
sides, each headed by a champion, and with
bets staked on the outcome. Often in ballads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
and folklore the hero's escape from
death and final triumph hinge upon the
guessing of a riddle.</p>

<p>The Semitic people held in high regard
the power to read riddles, and this power,
as in the story of Solomon, blends with the
higher intelligence which makes for wisdom.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous of Hebrew
conundrums is that of Samson, the strong
of intellect as of body, who, when he found
the honey which the wild bees had placed in
the carcass of a lion, read to the Philistines
this riddle: "Out of the eater came forth
meat, and out of the strong came forth
sweetness."</p>

<p>Among the Greeks and Romans, as
among earlier peoples, all forms of wit and
play of word and fancy were tried and popular.
D'Israeli, in his "Curiosities of Literature,"
records that "It is certain that
Cicero was an inveterate punster; and he
seems to have been more ready with them
than with repartees."</p>

<p>The story of the famous riddle of the
Sphinx comes down from Greek mythology.
The city of Thebes was infested by a monster
having the body of a lion and the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
part of a woman. She lay crouching upon
a rock near a narrow pass which led to the
city, and propounded to all travelers a riddle,
allowing all who guessed to pass safely,
but killing all who failed. The uniform failure
of all who came, and their subsequent
slaughter, made great lamentation in the
city. &OElig;dipus, the unacknowledged son of
the King of Thebes, who had shortly before
unknowingly killed his father, undertook to
rid the city of the monster. He boldly confronted
the Sphinx, who asked him the riddle,
"What animal is it that in the morning
goes on four feet, at noon on two, and in
the evening upon three?" &OElig;dipus replied,
"Man, who in childhood creeps on hands
and knees, in manhood walks erect, and in
old age goes with the aid of a staff."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
Sphinx thereupon cast herself from the
rock and perished, and the Thebans made
&OElig;dipus king.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See Gayley's "Classic Myths in English Literature
and in Art" (Boston, Ginn and Company, 1911).</p></div>

<p>There is one age-old riddle, still current
in Brittany, Germany, and Gascony, about
which the tradition hovers that Homer died
with vexation at not being able to discover
the answer. It is, "What we caught we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
threw away, what we could not catch we
kept."</p>

<p>Early folklore riddles dealt with natural
phenomena. With the Wolofs the riddle of
the wind asks, "What flies forever and rests
never?" The Teutonic form was, "What
can go in the face of the sun, yet leave no
shadow?" The Basutos of South Africa
ask: "What is wingless and legless, yet
flies fast and cannot be imprisoned?" and
answer, "The voice."</p>

<p>The oldest English riddles extant are
among the fragments found in "The Exeter
Book." These date back to the eighth century
and were written in Northumbria.
While these are not conundrums in the modern
sense, they are very elaborate studies of
analogy, and contain some of the most
imaginative of Anglo-Saxon poetry.</p>

<p>In the early half of the <a class="corr" name="TC_1" id="TC_1" title="seventeeth">seventeenth</a> century
there were published several small
books, which contain the sources of many of
the conundrums of the present day. These
books have been brought together by W.
Carew Hazlitt, under the title "Shakespeare's
Jest-Books" (London, 1864). The
dates of these books are variously 1600,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
1630, 1636, and 1639. The form is narrative,
with occasional dialogue, and approaches
that of the conundrum, and the wit
though far from subtle is often effective.
Though the names of the authors of some of
these books are known, the authorship of
others is in doubt. They were to a considerable
extent not attributable to one man,
but were the bright sayings of the day.</p>

<p>The first chapter of the present volume,
entitled "Early English Wit," brings together,
in modernized form, some of the
brightest of these sayings. The strangest
thing about such a collection is to discover of
what antiquity some current conundrums are.
That is notably true of one taken from "Demaundes
Joyous," printed by Wynkyn de
Worde in 1511, namely:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"<i>Demaund.</i> How many straws go to a
goose's nest?<br />
<span class="answer">"<i>A.</i> None, for lack of feet.</span>
</p></div>

<p>Besides the puns which may be made
within a language itself, through the variety
of meanings of words and the similarity of
sound in different words, there is a certain
class of hybrid puns and conundrums which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
is made by the interchange of languages.
The following story illustrates this class: A
newly appointed and bashful young curate
was visiting a young ladies' school in his
parish. The ordeal of facing so many
blooming young misses was endured until,
the class in Virgil having been found ill-prepared
and the teacher having requested that
the translation be made word for word, he
was startled by the declaration made by a
pretty young lady, "We kiss him in turn"
(<em>Vicissim</em>, in turn), whereupon he ungallantly
fled.</p>

<p>When Laud was Archbishop to Charles
I, it is related that the Court Jester made
the punning grace, "Great praise be to God
and little Laud to the Devil," which resulted
in his banishment by the Archbishop.</p>

<p>Shakespeare uses the conundrum with a
masterly hand, ringing many changes upon
it and producing many effects, both grave
and gay. An example of the quizzical dialogue
which has the wit of the conundrum as
its basis, is found in "Twelfth Night," Act
I., scene 5:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Clown.</i> Good madonna, why mournest thou?<br />
<i>Olivia.</i> Good fool, for my brother's death.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
<i>Clown.</i> I think his soul is in hell, madonna.<br />
<i>Olivia.</i> I know his soul is in heaven, fool.<br />
<i>Clown.</i> The more fool, madonna, to mourn for
your brother's soul being in heaven.
</p></div>

<p>While the conundrum ranks as the formal
literary representative of the spontaneous
pun, the literature of wit is alive with the
naked pun in its original state. Pope, Hood,
Lamb, and Holmes are the names of some
whose punning arraignments of puns and
punsters make them at once judges and prisoners
at the bar.</p>

<p>Theodore Hook is accredited with the
original pun which is the basis of a common
conundrum. He bragged that he could
make a pun on any subject, and immediately
a friend suggested that he make one on the
King. "The King is no subject," was the
prompt rejoinder.</p>

<p>The poems of Thomas Hood, the "king
of punsters," abound in puns, and the sort
of wit, subtle or broad, which may be expressed
in puns. He was primarily a poet,
and manipulated words in a masterly
fashion, not letting them deflect his thought.
An example of the inevitableness of his punning
is found in the poem on "Sally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
Brown": "They went and told the sexton,
and the sexton toll'd the bell."</p>

<p>A friendly contest between Hook and
Hood, as to which could make the best pun,
resulted in a draw, the efforts of the two
men being of equal merit, according to the
friend who was called upon to decide.</p>

<p>Alexander Pope, although disapproving
of the pun as a trifling form of wit, once
challenged his hearers to suggest a word
upon which he could not make a pun. The
word "keelhauling," meaning to draw a
man under a ship, was given by a woman
present. "That, Madam," replied Pope,
"is indeed putting a man under a hardship."</p>

<p>The incident is told of Charles Lamb that
once when in Salisbury Cathedral the constable
remarked to him that eight people had
dined at the top of the spire; whereupon
Lamb remarked that they must be "very
sharp set."</p>

<p>The story is told that a man noted for his
wit in puns was asked in regard to the writings
of Thomas Carlyle if he did not like
"to expatiate in such a field?" He replied,
"No. I can't get over the stile (style)."</p>

<p>From the riddle or pun it is but a short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
step to the conundrum, which takes the pun
from its purely factitious setting and gives it
a general application and a permanent form.
It is, when rightly constructed, at once interesting
and instructive, teaching as much
by negative as by affirmative statement. It
embodies the ever new analogies between
dissimilar things, and with a language so fertile
in idiom as the English aids in its mastery.
Used in application to historical
and geographical subjects it may serve to
fix names and places definitely in memory,
as well as facts which but for the humorous
interest given to them would be dry and
easily forgotten.</p>

<p>There is a certain distinctive flavor to the
current conundrums of a period which tells
more of the popular interests of the time
than anything but a newspaper could. The
best conundrums of each period, or those
that center around a great event, would
make most illuminating historical reading.
The opinions of the day are often more
clearly expressed in a conundrum than in an
essay. It would have been of interest to
know what the wits, as well as the historians,
said of Napoleon at Waterloo, of the Boston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
Tea Party, and of Washington and the
Continental Congress. Possibly the opinion
of posterity would not have differed so
widely from that of the wits as from that of
the contemporary chroniclers.</p>

<p>John Taylor, whose book, "Wit and
Mirth," published in 1630, was one of the
oldest and most distinctive original collections,
was the forerunner of such punning
poets as Hood and Holmes. In the dedication
of his book, in order to forestall criticism
for the publishing of sayings already
well-known, he says: "Because I had
many of them (the jests) by relation and
heare-say, I am in doubt that some of them
may be in print in some other Authors,
which I doe assure you is more then I doe
know." The authors of all compilations of
conundrums in the almost three centuries
since have had to make increasingly comprehensive
acknowledgment, which the present
author here hastens to give, having drawn
from the great common sources, as well as
from the unpublished current wit of the day.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smcap">Early English Wit</span></h2>


<p>In the anecdotes, dry remarks, repartees,
and posers of this chapter, the sayings of
which were current from about 1600 on to
the present day, is seen the growth of the
modern form of conundrum, which is adhered
to largely in the remaining chapters
of this book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A poet was asked where his wits were.
"A-wool-gathering," he answered. "No
people have more need of it," was the reply.</p>

<p>A good client is like a study gown, which
sits in the cold himself to keep his lawyer
warm.</p>

<p>"Why do lawyers' clerks write such wide
lines?" "It is done to keep the peace.
For if the plaintiff should be in one line and
the defendant in the next, with the lines too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
near together, they might perhaps fall together
by the ears."</p>

<p>A master spoke in a strain which his
servant did not understand. The servant
thereupon asked that his master might
rather give him blows than such hard words.</p>

<p>What great scholar is this same Finis, because
his name is to almost every book?<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Hazlitt considers this witticism, found in "Conceits,
Clinches, Flashes, and Whimzies" (London,
1639), the earliest of its kind, and calls attention to
the discussion as to whether Shakespeare's plays were
written by <em>Mr. Preface</em> or <em>Mr. Finis</em>.</p></div>

<p>A prodigal is like a brush that spends
itself to make others go handsome in their
clothes.</p>

<p>An antiquary loves everything for being
moldy and worm-eaten,&mdash;as Dutchmen do
cheese.</p>

<p>It was said that a player had "an idle employment
of it." "You are mistaken," was
the reply, "for his whole life is nothing
else but action."</p>

<p>A simple fellow in gay clothes was likened
to a cinnamon tree,&mdash;because the bark was
of more worth than the body.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>One asked a favor of a prisoner, saying
that he had hitherto found him a fast friend,
and hoped he should find him so still.</p>

<p>A scholar who was much given to going
abroad, was advised that he put away his
cushion, as he would then "sit harder to his
study."</p>

<p>It was remarked that "poetry and plain
dealing were a couple of handsome wenches."
It was replied that "he who weds himself
to either of them shall die a beggar."</p>

<p>Why are women so crooked and perverse
in their conditions? <span class="answer">Because the first woman
was made of a crooked thing.</span></p>

<p>One was advised to marry a little woman,
because "of evils the least was to be
chosen."</p>

<p>A rich lawyer, whose fortune had been
made by the practice of his profession, desired
to bequeath a certain sum to the insane
asylum of Bedlam. Being questioned
why, he replied that he had got his money
of mad men, and he would give it to them
again.</p>

<p>The trade of tooth drawer is a conscienceless
one, because it is "nothing else but to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
take away those things whereby every man
gets his living."</p>

<p>"A vainglorious man" was bragging that
his father and uncle had founded a certain
hospital. One answered, "'Tis true, but yet
know that your father and your uncle were
the mere confounders (co-founders) of that
hospital you speak of."</p>

<p>It was said that corn was a quarrelsome
creature, because it rose by the blade, and
fell by the ears with those that cut it.</p>

<p>A tailor was commended for his dexterity,
whereupon it was remarked that tailors had
their business at their fingers' ends.</p>

<p>Colliers and mine-workers, it was said,
should be well acquainted with all the philosophical
secrets of the earth, because they
had a deeper knowledge of it than any
others.</p>

<p>"Of all knaves there's the greatest hope
of a cobbler, for though he be never so idle
a fellow, yet he is still mending."</p>

<p>"A smith," said one, "is the most pragmatical
fellow under the sun, for he hath always
many irons in the fire."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The proverb, "Wit bought is better than
wit taught," had added to it the comment,
"because he that never bought any is but
a natural wit," embodying the play on the
word "natural," the early name for "fool."</p>

<p>Tall men are the most happy, because
they are nearer heaven than other men.
They should also be great politicians, because
they have extraordinary reach.</p>

<p>Of all soldiers musketeers are the most
lazy, for they are always at rest.</p>

<p>It is necessary that some rich men be
dunces, because pretenders to learning may
get preferment, and good wits will be able
to help themselves.</p>

<p>Carpenters are the most civil men because
they never do their business without a rule.</p>

<p>A hangman is the most trusty of friends,
for, if he once have to do with a man, he
will see him hanged before he shall want
money or anything else.</p>

<p>Physicians have the best of it. If they do
well, the world proclaims it; if ill, the earth
covers it.</p>

<p>A man and his wife were fighting. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
was asked why he did not part them, and replied,
that he "had been better bred than to
part man and wife."</p>

<p>Tobacconists (users of tobacco) would endure
war well, for they would never be stifled
with fire and smoke.</p>

<p>Fiddlers are very unfortunate in their
calling, for they never do anything but it is
against the hair (fiddlestring).</p>

<p>Smiths are the most irregular of handicrafts
men, because they never think that
they are better employed than when they
are addicted to their vices.</p>

<p>It is no great matter what a drunkard says
in his drink, for he never says anything that
